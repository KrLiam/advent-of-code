# Advent Of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code challenge.

## Installation

This package uses `poetry`.

`poetry install`

## Usage

Use `poetry run solve <year> <day>` to run the solution for the puzzle of the
given year and day.

By default, this command runs the first part of the puzzle. To run the second part,
use `poetry run solve <year> <day> --part-2`.
